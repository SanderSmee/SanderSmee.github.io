My coworker points me to the presentation of Aslak Helles√∏y, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE_1nh0DdbY[Sub-second acceptance tests].
As we're struggling with long running and brittle acceptance tests, that provoking title triggers my interest, and I start watching the recording...

The most interesting thing about the talk is not the speed of the tests, but of course how to accomplish faster tests.
Less surprising might be that there isn't a lightning fast (test) framework that can deliver the sub-second tests.
And also that there's no magical trick to get those tests so fast.
Getting to fast acceptance tests has all to do with good software architecture practices.

== Composing software
Being able to exchange certain parts of your system can make that system easier to test.
If the parts you can replace contain the bounds of the system, then those bounds can temporarily be put aside.

****
The bounds we're referring to are the IO-bounds of a system, for example

a HTTP call to the system, or a connection the system has to a database.
****

For parts of your system to be easy replaceable, they need well thought of interfaces or (API) contracts.
This correspondents to the _Liskov substitution principle_ one of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID[SOLID] principles.
An IO-bound implementation of that contract could be replaced with a mock or stub without altering the correctness of that subpart of the system.

== Acceptance tests
Secondly is that acceptance test descriptions should be decoupled from how they interact with the system under test.
When those test contain only functional or business language, it's up to a framework like cucumber to connect those descriptions to the system to test.
And that, combined with the API or interfaces of the business domain, let's you choose what parts of the system you want during the execution of the tests.

== Testable architecture
Aslak recommends the talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk4rCn4YLLU[End to end functional tests that can run in milliseconds] by Nat Pryce.
Nat mentions the software architecture that enables these abilities: https://web.archive.org/web/20180822100852/http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture[hexagonal architecture].
He has written before about testing well architected software in http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000772.html[Visualising Test Terminology].
These ideas are repeated by Aslak in his previous talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwH83PjR98g[Testable Architectures].

== Conclusion
So, if you want you your tests to be easier to write and faster to execute, it's important to have an architecture that supports that.
Hexagonal architecture does that by separating technical and business concerns.
When you also keep technical concerns out of your acceptance tests, you may connect those directly to the business interfaces of the system.
Thereby avoiding the technical, and usually slowest, part of the system, to increase the speed of acceptance test execution.
